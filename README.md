# NN-DL-CV
Repository for notebooks about deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision in Python using Tensorflow Keras library and Scikit-Learn.

# Hey!
You can find one main file, *Machine_Learning_Course_Code*, with a full copy of the codes from the machine learning course divided into chapters. It starts by implementing **Regression** techniques, then **Classification** algorithms, Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, and finally **Neural Networks** and **Convolutional Neural Networks**. 

## Kaggle courses notes
The second type of notes is divided into Deep Learning, Computer Vision, etc. These notes contain information from Kaggle and a little explanation of code.  

## Statistical data analysis project
A notebook containing the project for the statistical analysis of a selected dataset.
