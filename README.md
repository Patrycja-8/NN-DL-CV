# NN-DL-CV
Repository for notebooks about deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision in Python using Tensorflow Keras library and Scikit-Learn.

# Hey Girl!
You can find one main file *Machine_Learning_Course_Code* with a full copy of codes from the machine learning course divided into chapters. It starts from implementing **Regression** techniques, then **Classification** algorithms, Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, and finally **Neural Networks** and **Convolutional Neural Networks**. 

## Kaggle courses notes
Second type of notes are divided into Deep Learning, Computer Vision, etc. These notes are made of info from Kaggle and a little explanation of code.
